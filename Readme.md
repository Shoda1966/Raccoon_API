There are 2 versions of the API.
The server_api.js is for running/using the API on your own KVM/VPS server. I would perfer to use a domain to connecting!

The localhost_api.js is made to test something with this API and only runs on your own local device/pc. Find it in browser with localhost:3000

Easy to use and setup API for Raccoon Images

The imageinformation is in imgs.json fetched from google with node package g-i-s.

To setup just link your domain, install all packages with ```npm i``` and start the api with ```node api.js```.
